 * individual - once shared it is visible to EVERY portal user of that client. A shared
 * document is a 'documents' File_Attachment of the client that has at least one
 * Shared_Item_Model row (item_type='File_Attachment_Model'); the per-contact rows only
 * record who was specifically invited + emailed. The workspace scope (client) is taken
 * from a membership gate, never from a client-supplied user id. End-user applications
 * will likely replace this with a more granular per-document / per-contact model.
 *
 * Authorization: the class-level #[Auth('is_logged_in')] gate (portal realm) admits
 * only a logged-in portal user. list() additionally fails closed for a client the
 * caller is not a member of via Portal_Permission::has_client_access().
