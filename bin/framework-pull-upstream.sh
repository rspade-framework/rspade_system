# RSpade Framework Update Script
# =============================================================================
# Pulls the framework (system/) up to date from the rspade_system distribution
# repository. In the current downstream topology system/ is ORDINARY TRACKED
# FILES in the app repo (no git submodule, no gitlink). This script therefore
# never merges: it clones the distribution into a temp checkout and reconciles
# the working tree file-by-file. It then COMMITS its own system/ changes as one
# dedicated framework-update commit (see COMMIT MODEL below). It runs BEFORE
# Laravel loads (via the artisan pre-boot interception) so a broken framework can
# still be repaired.
#
# ARCHITECTURE
#   - OWNED ZONES (app/RSpade, vendor, node_modules, bin, docs + the files
#     artisan and .rspade-release.json) are the framework's exclusively. They are
#     hard-synced from the new release with rsync --delete: whatever the release
#     ships is exactly what lands. Local edits there are removed (a --force run
#     doubles as the repair path).
#   - THE REMAINING TREE is reconciled with a three-way file comparison against
#     the currently-installed release and the new release, so genuine local
#     system/ changes outside the owned zones are preserved and conflicts are
#     reported (never silently clobbered without --force).
#   - The mutation-marker store (storage/rsx-framework) records the framework's
#     own churn so the offline tamper gate (rsx:framework:verify) can tell a real
#     local edit from a framework-authored one BY CONSTRUCTION - no regex.
#   - The distribution cache (a bare clone of rspade_system) is pure re-derivable
#     data and lives OUTSIDE the app tree, at /tmp/rspade_upstream.git - see
#     Framework_Maintenance::upstream_cache_dir(), the PHP source of truth.
#
# COMMIT MODEL (system/ is framework-owned)
#   system/ is committed ONLY by this updater, in its own commit
#   (commit_system_update) made BEFORE the rebuild, so it captures the PRISTINE
#   DISTRIBUTION STATE exactly as synced. Three properties follow, and they are the
#   whole reason for the ordering:
#     * A FAILED REBUILD IS HARMLESS. The release is already in history, so every
#       later rsx:clean / pre-commit-hook reset lands ON the new release instead of
#       reverting it. Committing after the rebuild made a deterministic rebuild
#       failure unrecoverable: the release sat synced-but-uncommitted, and the next
#       app commit's hook reset it away. A release shipping a mandatory app
#       migration (whose build cannot pass until the app migrates, which needs app
#       commits) deadlocked on that forever. The repair for a post-commit rebuild
#       failure is now simply a REBUILD (dev auto-rebuild, or rsx:manifest:build) -
#       never a re-pull.
#     * CHURN IS ALWAYS-LOCAL. Framework runtime churn (class-override
#       .php <-> .php.upstream renames, use-header rewrites) is regenerate-on-demand
#       state, exactly as every other rebuild-churn path already treats it:
#       uncommitted-but-VISIBLE system/ modifications that rsx:clean resets and the
#       next build regenerates. It is not hidden (the retired skip-worktree +
#       *.php.upstream devices were), and the mutation-marker ledger still authorizes
#       it for the tamper gate (rsx:framework:verify).
#     * THE COMMITTED TREE IS THE RELEASE, AND NOTHING ELSE. The commit is built in a
#       throwaway index that is normalized (normalize_commit_index) and then asserted
#       path-for-path against .rspade-release.json (assert_index_matches_release):
#       class-override sidecars come out, and EVERY tracked path under system/ the
#       release does not ship is untracked from the commit. Owner ruling, 2026-08-18:
#       "system gets rsynced from the framework metaphorically with --delete" - there
#       are no local additions to a vendored read-only tree, so there is no escape
#       hatch and no allowlist. The working tree is never touched by that; the disk-side
#       purge is a peer's next rsx:git reset, which is the intended outcome. A box whose
#       marker is already current repairs its committed baseline the same way, commit
#       only (see main()'s up-to-date branch).
#     * SISTER ENVIRONMENTS CONVERGE. A pristine commit is byte-identical for the
#       same release everywhere, so two boxes pulling it with different app override
#       sets no longer produce diverging framework commits - a whole class of
#       system/ merge conflict disappears.
#   A pre-commit hook (installed by bin/post-update.sh ->
#   bin/environment_updates/020_precommit_hook.sh, keyed RSPADE-PRECOMMIT-V1) resets
#   + unstages system/ from ordinary app commits so the framework and app histories
#   never mix; the updater bypasses it via RSPADE_FRAMEWORK_COMMIT=1 + --no-verify.
#   system/ must NEVER be gitignored (ensure_system_not_ignored) and the old git
#   skip-worktree + *.php.upstream hiding is retired
#   (migrate_legacy_override_hygiene) - either would mask drift and silently drop the
#   override zone from the commit. --no-commit leaves the synced release uncommitted
#   for manual commit (and warns loudly - see warn_synced_uncommitted);
#   --check-foreign-changes is a read-only system/ drift probe (exit 1 if dirty).
#
# WHAT RELEASE IS INSTALLED - ONE AUTHORITY
#   system/.rspade-release.json, and nothing else. Its release_id is matched against
#   the cached distribution history to resolve OLD_SHA; no match makes the run a
#   BASELINE (no changelog, conservative three-way).
#
#   rsx/resource/framework_update_history.dat (committed, lives under rsx/ so the sync
#   never touches it) is a LOG. It records each update, newest section first, with a
#   machine-readable first line:
#       ## RSPADE-UPDATE <ISO8601Z> from=<old_sha|BASELINE> to=<new_sha>
#   It is READ for exactly one purpose: to warn when its `to=` contradicts the marker.
#   It decides nothing. Until 2026-08-18 it was the PRIMARY resolution, which made two
#   independently-merging files both authoritative - and when a backwards merge made
#   them disagree, the run read "up to date" off the log and then repaired the tree to
#   the older marker, untracking 7,503 paths (Ascent). The marker travels inside the
#   tree it describes; the log does not.
#
# --resync
#   Restore every owned zone to the distribution tip and re-commit system/ as that
#   release, whatever any marker claims. The recovery path after a backwards merge has
#   moved a tree off its release. It is NOT --force: locally modified files still go
#   through the tamper gate, so accepted committed drift survives.
#
# LLM AGENTS: never pass --force without explicit user permission. --force
# DESTROYS local changes under the framework-owned zones and takes the upstream
# side of every three-way conflict.
#
# The live .sh is generated from this .dist by the artisan interception; edit the
# .dist only.

# Configuration

# The public distribution repo (anonymous https - no credentials required to pull).
# publish dual-pushes every release here and to the internal repo; a box with a reason
# to pull elsewhere passes --upstream-url= explicitly.
DEFAULT_UPSTREAM_URL="https://github.com/rspade-framework/rspade_system.git"
UPSTREAM_BRANCH="master"

# Owned-zone directories (relative to system/). Kept in lockstep with
# Framework_Mutations::owned_zones(). Hard-synced with rsync --delete.
#
# database/ is owned (added 2026-08-11, Ascent incident): framework migrations are
# IMMUTABLE once shipped and are never legitimately authored, edited or deleted
# downstream - an app's own migrations live in rsx/resource/migrations/, and
# make:migration:safe routes there whenever is_framework_developer is false, so
# nothing downstream ever writes under system/database/. Leaving it to the
# three-way pass meant a lost migration was inferred to be a deliberate local
# deletion and preserved FOREVER (see three_way_pass), so a box could sit a full
# release behind on schema while every pull reported success. Hard-syncing makes
# that loss self-healing, exactly as it already is for bin/ and app/RSpade/.
#
# config/, resources/ and supervisor/ are owned for the same reason (2026-08-11):
# all three are framework property with an app-side equivalent elsewhere. App config
# overrides live in rsx/resource/config/ and are merged over the framework's
# (Rsx_Framework_Provider); app views live in rsx/; supervisor/ holds the framework's
# own service definitions. Nothing downstream writes to any of them, and no framework
# code generates files there at runtime - both verified before this was widened.
# public/ is deliberately NOT owned: it is the docroot, where an app legitimately
# places its own static assets.
OWNED_DIRS=(app/RSpade vendor node_modules bin docs database config resources supervisor)

# Owned-zone individual FILES (relative to system/) - a first-class peer of the
# directory list, not a two-entry special case. Any single file may be owned, and is
# then synced authoritatively exactly like a directory.
#
# .gitignore is owned (2026-08-11): it is framework-authored, it governs
# framework-tree hygiene, and it is exactly the kind of file an app is tempted to
# tweak - after which three_way_pass preserves the local edit and that box silently
# stops receiving every future upstream ignore rule. The same shape already cost a
# downstream app an outage: one local edit to config/rsx.php froze the file, and two
# releases later it was still frozen.
#
# app/Http/Kernel.php is owned (2026-08-19): it is pure framework wiring - the
# maintenance/migration/Playwright middlewares and the deliberate REMOVALS of
# Laravel's session/CSRF/ConvertEmptyStrings entries - and a framework release
# regularly has to edit it on the app's behalf. Left to the three-way pass, one
# local tweak freezes it and that box stops receiving every future change to the
# request stack. Apps extend it through config('rsx.middleware') instead, which
# is append-only and survives every update (php artisan rsx:man config_rsx).

# a process cut short mid-write, makes git exit non-zero with "Another git process
# seems to be running in this repository". That is CONTENTION, not corruption: the
# holder finishes in well under a second, so a short retry clears it. Before this,
# one unlucky moment aborted the whole framework update.
#
# NOT retried: a genuine git error (bad pathspec, unmerged files, nothing to commit).
# Those do not improve by waiting, so they return their real exit code immediately and
# the caller decides. Only the lock signature is treated as transient.

# =============================================================================
# check_tree_complete - is every file this release ships actually ON DISK?
#
# The release inventory (.rspade-release.json) is the authoritative list of what a
# correct install contains, and NOTHING compared it against disk. That gap is what
# let a box sit a full release behind on schema while `rsx:framework:pull` reported
# "up to date" and rsx:framework:status agreed (Ascent, 2026-08-11).
#
# A missing file has exactly ONE innocent explanation - the class-override rename
# that moves `X.php` aside to `X.php.upstream` - so that is the only exemption, the
# same one Framework_Verify applies.
#
# TWO CATEGORIES, OPPOSITE ANSWERS. The inventory covers the WHOLE release, but the
# updater's reach does not: the owned-zone rsync and the three-way pass between them
# cover everything except storage/, and a path can only be repaired if the release
# also HOLDS a copy of it. Reporting both categories the same way produced a check
# that could dead-end on paths NOTHING - `--force` included - has the power to
# restore, and 7,326 phantom entries then camouflaged 15 real losses 490-to-1. So:
#
#   * REPAIRABLE (reachable AND present in the release) -> return 1. The caller
#     converges the tree by running the ordinary passes. No flag, no ceremony:
#     restoring a file that is not there destroys nothing, so there is no decision
#     for an operator to make.
#   * ORPHANED (everything else) -> advisory only. Named, counted, and given honest
#     advice; never fatal, and never "try --force", which would be a lie.
#
# Returns 0 when there is no repairable work, 1 when there is. NO TIMEOUT: this is
# ~100k stat calls and takes as long as the filesystem takes.

# prune_store - RECONCILE the mutation-marker store at the pristine moment (right
# after the owned-zone sync restored pristine files). This REPLACES the old blind
# wipe.
#
# THE RACE it closes (B-52): a downstream box is LIVE - cron, supervisor workers
# and web requests boot artisan continuously, and each boot runs the dev auto-
# rebuild. A boot firing between owned_zone_sync and this call can LEGITIMATELY
# re-apply the framework's own churn (class-override renames, use-header rewrites)
# AND record it in the marker store. A blind `rm` then DESTROYS those valid
# records, and the pull's own rebuild - finding the churn already applied - is an
# idempotent fixpoint that no-ops and records nothing, leaving an EMPTY ledger so
# the next verify false-flags all of that churn forever (the ascent field failure).
# No reset ordering can serialize the pull against unbounded concurrent boots.
#
# The reconciling prune keeps every marker whose recorded content STILL matches
# disk (a concurrent-boot record is exactly as good as one the pull's own rebuild
# would write, whenever it was written) and drops only the stale ones - so the
# race dissolves. Running it right after the sync (before three_way_pass, which
# never touches owned zones the markers cover) shrinks - it does not rely on -
# the window.
#
# Primary path: the artisan prune command (needs a working PHP), wrapped in the
# lock-retry loop because on a live box its OWN artisan boot contends with the
# concurrent auto-rebuild for the build lock (the ascent field failure: the prune
# boot died on a 30s lock timeout).
#
# Two failure classes need OPPOSITE handling:
#   * LOCK TIMEOUT after all retries - positive PROOF a concurrent boot is alive and
#     actively re-recording framework churn (a rebuild is holding the lock the whole
#     window). Wiping now would destroy exactly the valid, freshly-recorded markers
#     the reconciling prune exists to keep. So DO NOT WIPE - skip and heal next pull.
#   * NON-lock failure (PHP fatal, missing class, command not found) - artisan cannot
#     boot at all, so NOTHING is concurrently recording churn a wipe could lose. The
#     wholesale reset is the safe degradation THERE, and the subsequent forced rebuild
#     re-records from scratch on the freshly-synced pristine tree. (This degraded path
#     can in principle re-open the race, accepted: it only fires when PHP is broken,
#     where nothing is concurrently rebuilding.)

#
# Format, per distribution commit: a header line `<sha> <date> <release subject>` then the
# commit BODY. The two halves are BOTH load-bearing:
#
#   %b   is where the substance lives. bin/publish embeds every underlying monorepo commit's
#        FULL message - subject and body - into the release commit's body, so a single
#        distribution commit's %b is the complete rationale for everything in that release
#        (48KB for an 18-commit release, measured). This is why the changelog does not need
#        to "reach through" the release squash: the squash already carries the text.
#   %s   is the release-boundary marker, and the FLOOR. A release subject on its own is
#        nearly content-free ("RSpade framework release X..Y (N commits)"), which is exactly
#        why the commit message used to be useless - it had ONLY this. But it must stay:

# migrate_legacy_override_hygiene - one-time (idempotent) migration off the OLD
# commit model, distributed to the whole fleet via the updater. The previous
# updater HID framework runtime churn by (a) setting git skip-worktree on the
# system/app/RSpade zone and (b) adding a *.php.upstream gitignore line. The new
# model has commit_system_update state the whole system/ tree deliberately - as the
# RELEASE, with the class-override pair normalized out of the commit (see its header;
# hiding devices are neither needed nor sufficient for that) - so both MUST go:
#   (a) skip-worktree MUST be cleared and NEVER reapplied - `git add -f -A --
#       system` in commit_system_update honors -f over gitignore but NOT over
#       skip-worktree, so a left-set bit silently drops the override zone from
#       the commit. This is the exact piece the sandbox reference missed (a
#       fresh repo never had the bit set).
#   (b) the *.php.upstream ignore line is removed so the sidecars are VISIBLE to
#       git status / --check-foreign-changes - they are always-local churn and the
#       operator is entitled to see them. Visible is not the same as committed:
#       commit_system_update normalizes them out of the commit, so a sidecar shows

# regenerate-on-demand state the ledger authorizes for the tamper gate.
#
# "PRISTINE" IS NOW ENFORCED, NOT ASSUMED. The old claim held only for churn THIS
# run's rebuild would author; churn the PREVIOUS run left on disk (the class-override
# pair `X.php` gone + `X.php.upstream` present) was staged verbatim and published as
# framework content. The tree is therefore assembled deliberately - see the block
# above the index build below - and asserted against the release inventory before it
# is committed: THE COMMITTED system/ TREE IS THE RELEASE, WHICHEVER BOX RAN THE PULL.
# Pristine by construction is also why the commit needs no authorization gate of its
# own - the tamper gate's real job is refusing to OVERWRITE hand edits at sync time.
# Scoped exactly as `git commit -- <paths>` was (everything unnamed comes from HEAD),

#   PASS 2  EVERY tracked path under system/ the release inventory does not list is
#           untracked from the commit (__untrack_foreign_paths_in_index).
#
# PASS 1 - the class-override pair.
#
# A class override (rsx:man class_override) moves the framework's `X.<ext>` aside to
# `X.<ext>.upstream` and lets the app's copy answer to the class name. That pair is
# ALWAYS-LOCAL, regenerate-on-demand state: it is authored by this box's manifest
# build, it differs per box, and no commit anywhere may record it. Committed, it
# publishes one box's override set as framework content - which is exactly what
# happened: `R100 X.php -> X.php.upstream` entered shared history, the real framework
# filename stopped being tracked at all, upstream changes began arriving INSIDE the
# sidecar, and the next box's pull aborted on its own untracked sidecar colliding with
# the incoming tracked blob (Ascent, 2026-08-18).
#
# For every sidecar on disk: drop the sidecar path from the index, and stage the
# RELEASE's copy of the real filename in its place. The release checkout is the
# authority - the sidecar on disk belongs to whatever release was installed when the
# rename happened, and HEAD may not carry the real filename at all.
#
# THIS IS ALSO THE DECONTAMINATION PATH. On a box whose HEAD already tracks sidecars
# (seven paths went fleet-wide before this existed), the same two operations record
# "delete X.php.upstream / add X.php", so the first post-fix pull that commits
# anything converges the shared tree with no hand surgery and no one-off commit.
#
# The working tree is deliberately NOT repaired here: this box is RUNNING on that
# override pair, and re-creating `X.php` beside a live `X.php.upstream` corrupts it
# (the same reason three_way_pass refuses to restore that one absence).

#
# THE RULING (owner, 2026-08-18): "system gets rsynced from the framework
# metaphorically with --delete - any tracked files in the destination not in the
# framework distribution within 'owned' directories must be untracked and deleted
# from git." system/ is a vendored, machine-owned, READ-ONLY tree: the release IS the
# path set, and there is no such thing as a local addition to it that history may
# carry. So there is no escape hatch and no allowlist - a path the inventory does not
# name does not belong in the commit, full stop.
#
# What that removes in practice is machine-generated box state that `add -f -A --
# system` swept in and that history then published fleet-wide: fossil CLI-test
# storage trees, build/cache/route_patterns/*, bootstrap/cache/*.php,
# .env.replaced_by_healer - 7,480 paths on one field box.
#
# THE WORKING TREE IS NOT TOUCHED (same discipline as the sidecar pass): those files
# are live local state this box may still be running on. Untracking is a statement
# about HISTORY. The disk-side consequence is deliberate and stated in the ruling: a
# peer's next `rsx:git pull` reset (clean -fdq) removes what is no longer tracked.
#
# THE EXCLUSIONS ARE THE ASSERTION'S EXCLUSIONS, by construction - the two functions
# must agree, so both go through __release_partition_report (the inventory file
# itself, .env, storage/**).
#
# A missing/unreadable inventory untracks NOTHING - the same posture the assertion
# and check_tree_complete take: never refuse (or mutilate) a good update over a

    # =========================================================================
    # THE COMMIT'S TREE IS BUILT DELIBERATELY, IN A THROWAWAY INDEX.
    #
    # `git commit -- <paths>` cannot be used any more, and the reason is exact: with a
    # pathspec, git rebuilds the tree from HEAD plus the WORKING TREE content of the
    # named paths and IGNORES THE INDEX ENTIRELY. Every normalization of the index
    # would be silently discarded, and the working tree is the one thing that must not
    # be trusted here - it carries this box's class-override pairs.
    #
    # So the same semantics are reproduced by hand, one step at a time:
    #   1. seed a throwaway index from HEAD          (everything unnamed comes from HEAD)
    #   2. add the same pathspec set into it         (working-tree content for system/)
    #   3. normalize the index into the release       (see normalize_commit_index)
    #   4. assert the result IS the release          (see assert_index_matches_release)
    #   5. write-tree + commit-tree + update-ref     (commit exactly the tree we built)
    #
    # The developer's own index is never read or written by this, so in-flight app work
    # - staged or not - is untouchable by construction rather than by pathspec. No hook
    # runs on the plumbing path, which is what --no-verify + RSPADE_FRAMEWORK_COMMIT=1
    # were arranging anyway; the env var is kept on the call for anything that inspects
    # it. index.lock is not taken either: the staging add above is the operation that
    # proves the index is writable, and it is lock-retried.
